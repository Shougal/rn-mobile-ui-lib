# rn-local-ui-kit

A local React Native UI component library for iOS and Android apps. Built for internal use with reusable, styled components and demo screens to showcase props and interactive behavior.

## ðŸ“± Overview

This project serves two purposes:
- A **mobile app** built in React Native (runs on iOS and Android)
- A **local component library** with reusable UI elements (e.g. `Button`, `Card`, `Tag`) organized for scalable development

Each component is displayed through a **tab-based UI** with usage examples and real-time prop demonstration.

## Components

All components are located in `src/components`, each in its own folder with:
- `index.tsx`: Component logic
- `style.ts`: Component styling
- `type.ts`: Prop type definitions

### Example Structure:
src/
â””â”€â”€ components/
  â””â”€â”€ Button/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ style.ts
    â””â”€â”€ type.ts

##  Use Case
Perfect for:

Mobile teams building a shared component base
